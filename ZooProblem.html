        <li>Mona</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Do bears really eat honey? Contrary to what a popular icon would lead you to believe; bears diets mostly consist of fat and meat. Ollie and Mona's diets are salmon based with some frozen blackberries mixed in for an extra treat during the hot summer months. Grizzly and black bears eat mostly vegetation, insects, berries, and meat such as salmon, deer, and young mooses.
